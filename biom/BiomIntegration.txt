Tools:

breadcrumbs:
	Already integrated
	Check that the ManipulateTable script outputs the correct format BIOM or PCL.
	How do we handle breadcrumbs being referenced by all the projects.

microPITA:
	Already Integrated
	Input can be BIOM
	Output does nto make sense to be BIOM


MetaPhlan:
	Python script, can import breadcrumbs and call the function to write to file.
		Bulky but we do not want to rework the engine of MetaPhlan to use AbundanceTable.
	Output as BIOM?

HUMAnN:
	Input biome to PCL
		Can be a call in the SConscript
		HUMAnN does not get called as a script.
	Output from PCL to BIOM ?


LefSe:

R Scripts:
qiimeToMaaslin:
	I do not think this needs BIOM
	If input is BIOM just use updated MaAsLin
	If input is OTU table, use this and make a PCL file for MaAsLin
	If you do not want to use MaAsLin but want the normalization, use BreadCrumb's ManipulateTable.py script

MaAsLin:
	Input BIOM - Needs to be made
		As a sfle project this can be done easily
		As an R script Call...
